 ansible node1 -m package -a "name=httpd state=present"
 ansible node1 -m  copy -a "src=senthil.html dest=/var/www/html"
 ansible node1 -m service -a "name=httpd  state=started"

This adhoc command i want to convert as a code , so playbook comes into picture
Ansible use ymal language, yet anothermotckup language .

when we talk about variables
key: value  is the mostly used type 

Single value:
key value
key=value
key = value
key:value
key: value

Which is the Right format that  is very important 

key: value --> is theright format

Multiple values:

key: value1 value2 value3 in this type of values we need to  follow 
key:
 - vlaue1
 - value2
 - value3 
 - value4 --> The same space intent needs to follow, block of code space needs to be the  same 


Nowi  want to convert the below adhoc commands as  a playbook 

 ansible node1 -m package -a "name=httpd state=present"
 ansible node1 -m  copy -a "src=senthil.html dest=/var/www/html"
 ansible node1 -m service -a "name=httpd  state=started"

Fist we are defining the targets hosts, 

hosts: all
-m package -a "name=httpd state=present"
-m  copy -a "src=senthil.html dest=/var/www/html"
-m service -a "name=httpd  state=started"

-------


To define the below are called tasks

hosts: all
tasks:
- package: "name=httpd state=present"
- copy: "src=senthil.html dest=/var/www/html"
- service: "name=httpd  state=started"

------------

lets say i want more tasks below   are the example

hosts: node1
tasks:
- package: "name=httpd state=present"
- copy: "src=senthil.html dest=/var/www/html"
- service: "name=httpd  state=started"


hosts: node1, node2
tasks:
- package: "name=vlc state=present"
