Variable:
========
Normally we can use
vars:
   - x: 5
   - y: 10 
tasks:
   vars: x  --> if you define vars keyword it will tacken the value of the vriasble x . This is one method
vars01-example.yml 


Now  we can usee mse keyword to display the  string values , inbetween i want to call and display the value 
of  my variables, we can do like the below, This is called string interpolation.



- hosts: all
  vars:
   - x: 100
   - y: 200
  tasks:
   - debug:
      msg: "Hi Saba How are you doing today, Today i have yearned {{ x }} take care Bye as of Now" 



Suppose project needs to change Document Root folder path:
============================================================
Instead of the default path /var/www/html i want to use /var/www/linuxworld path 

so in the existing playbook two steps involved
1) We need to create new document folder 
2) Change the DocumnetRoot path  in configuration file /var/www/linuxworld

so inthe client side i edited like the below 
# cd /etc/httpd/conf.d

i  have created one file called linuxworld.conf and  add 
=====
[root@server1 ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/linuxworld.conf 
DocumentRoot /var/www/linuxworld
