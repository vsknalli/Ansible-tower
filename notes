When we  run the above command with setup module , which  will fetch  all the configuratoin information

Techniclly its know as facts and the module nme is "setup"

the setup module display is in JSON format.

The above mentioned are keys in dictonary as a key:value format , we can use this key:value in ansible playbook in 
blocks .

The above mentioned key:value is stored below one block this block is like a variable

We can fetch particular balock of value to display for that we can use

ansible 192.168.56.201 -m setup -a "filter=ansible_distribution"

ansible 192.168.56.201 -m setup -a "filter=ansible_*_mb"

ansible 192.168.56.201 -m setup -a "filter=*family*"

ansible 192.168.56.201 -m setup -a "filter=ansible_memtotal_mb"

ansible 192.168.56.201 -m setup -a "filter=*free*"

How we can  use this inbuild varaiable  in playbooks  , 

- name:  using default inbuild variables
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: using  debug module
    debug:  
      var: filter=ansible_distribution
